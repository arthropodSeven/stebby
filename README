# Stebby

Stebby is a tiny library for stubbing out APIs. I'm a frontend developer, and when I have an
idea for a project, I often think that it would be helpful if I could spec out the API first,
without putting a great deal of time into it, to think about how it should be put together in
relation to the frontend and the features I want the project to have. That's what this library
is for: you can connect stebby to your API library of choice (express, koa, hapi, whatever) and
use its functions to simulate making changes to data. The output will be written to YML files in
a `stebby/` subdirectory of your project, or you can use the `STEBBY` envvar to specify another
directory. 

This project is under active development and is not yet functional. Feel free to submit pull
requests or request features.
